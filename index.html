    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="./April piece.png" height="200">
    <h3>I was Born in a family of 8 just about the middle child but not quite. I helped my mom raise my two younger sisters while she was working and my dad was at his job as well. 
        I had learned how to cook for my family by around 16 and homeschooled my youngest in elementary. I had a truely hectic life but I wouldnt trade it for anything else unless 
        that something else included a pool then Id consider. All jokes aside my family was always full of life supported lots of learning in a self motivated environment and that
        truely helped me grow. When I had gotten my first job as an adult (due to the push for lean behavior) I was also encouraged to think for myself and look to learn new things.
        This is then what brought me to web design and I began my path in october of 2023 I invested in some courses and while I still worked full time I would always put aside at 
        least half an hour a day to my courses and my own exploration of coding and design.
